# Data Science Projects
Repository containing data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files.

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.*


# Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally

1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
